                                    <h2>Join the 2024 Class at African Leadership Academy (Fully funded scholarship available)</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The African Leadership Academy seeks to identify young leaders most likely to change the world. ALA is on a mission to find brilliant young people that possess the potential to transform the future of the African continent.<br>
                                    African Leadership Academy is not solely interested in students who excel academically; rather, they seek young individuals who possess the courage, initiative, and drive to make a positive impact on the world around them through their innovative ideas and forward-thinking initiatives. 
                                </p>
                                
                                <h4>Selection Criteria</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The ALA admissions process is designed to assess each candidate’s leadership potential and compatibility with its unique diploma program. ALA's approach is holistic, taking into account various factors such as intellectual readiness, courage, perseverance, ownership, and interdependence. It understands that diversity is a vital component of community strength, and so, it seeks to build a class with students from various backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives.<br>
                                    ALA does not expect uniformity; instead, it celebrates students' differences and encourages them to learn from one another. It assesses each applicant individually, and no single factor, except age, will be used to exclude any candidate. For admission in 2024, applicants must have been born on or after September 1, 2004.
                                </p>
                                <h4>1. Intellectual Readiness</h4>
                                <h5>Are you excited to push the boundaries of your learning?</h5>
                                <ol>
                                <li style="list-style-type:disc;">
                                    ALA students demonstrate academic achievement through strong performance and consistent improvement in their secondary school. They are driven to learn and achieve, and they set high standards for themselves. Their academic performance gives confidence that they can thrive in the rigorous ALA curriculum.
                                </li>
                                <li style="list-style-type:disc;">
                                    ALA students are intellectually curious. Their learning is not confined to a classroom. They seek to learn from every opportunity and challenge and aspire to be lifelong learners. They delight in learning when faced with an unfamiliar problem or new idea.
                                </li>
                                <li style="list-style-type:disc;">

                                <h4>2. Courage & Perseverance</h4>
                                <h5>Do you take the initiative to try new things and rigorously follow through even when you face setbacks?</h5>
                                <ol>

                                </li>
                                <li style="list-style-type:disc;">

                                <li style="list-style-type:disc;">
                                    ALA students are self-driven. They do not wait for instructions or only act when told by others. They take ownership of their own learning and leadership journey.
                                </li>
                                </ol>
                                <h4>3. Ownership</h4>
                                <h5>Do you have a genuine desire to make a positive impact on the world?</h5>
                                <ol>
                                <li style="list-style-type:disc;">
                                    ALA students are ambitious. They dream big; they set the bar high and push themselves to meet those standards.
                                </li>

                                    ALA students have a commitment to positive change and aspire beyond success for themselves to lives of significance, in which they are remembered for their impact on others.
                                </li>
                                <li style="list-style-type:disc;">

                                <h4>4. Interdependence</h4>
                                <h5>Are you excited to work and learn alongside other promising young people from across the continent in ALA’s diverse community</h5>
                                <ol>
                                <li style="list-style-type:disc;">
                                    ALA students are resourceful and seek help when needed. They are not afraid to seek help or activate their networks when they need support.

                                <p>
                                    Everyone who applies and is then admitted to ALA, regardless of financial background or nationality, is eligible to receive significant financial assistance in the form of scholarships towards studying at ALA and accessing membership to our lifelong network. The cost of tuition at ALA is $30,900 per year. African Leadership Academy fees are all-inclusive, including tuition, accommodation, meals, and uniforms.
                                     script>
                                <h5>97% of ALA students receive financial assistance.</h5>
                                    At ALA, the value of financial awards is determined after admissions decisions have been made. Fees charged to a given student will be based on a family’s financial means. ALA expects that every family will stretch themselves to finance the ALA education, just as they ask ALA’s network of supporters from around the world to stretch themselves to ensure that every admitted student is able to attend. Students from more financially disadvantaged backgrounds receive more significant financial assistance from ALA, and families with more resources are expected to contribute more to their child’s education at ALA.
